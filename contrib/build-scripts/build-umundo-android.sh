#    ANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a -  specifies the target Application Binary
#      Interface (ABI). This option nearly matches to the APP_ABI variable
#      used by ndk-build tool from Android NDK.
#
#      Possible targets are:
#        "armeabi" - matches to the NDK ABI with the same name.
#           See ${ANDROID_NDK}/docs/CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html for the documentation.
#        "armeabi-v7a" - matches to the NDK ABI with the same name.
#           See ${ANDROID_NDK}/docs/CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html for the documentation.
#        "armeabi-v7a with NEON" - same as armeabi-v7a, but
#            sets NEON as floating-point unit
#        "armeabi-v7a with VFPV3" - same as armeabi-v7a, but
#            sets VFPV3 as floating-point unit (has 32 registers instead of 16).
#        "armeabi-v6 with VFP" - tuned for ARMv6 processors having VFP.
#        "x86" - matches to the NDK ABI with the same name.
#            See ${ANDROID_NDK}/docs/CPU-ARCH-ABIS.html for the documentation.
#        "mips" - matches to the NDK ABI with the same name
#            (not testes on real devices)
